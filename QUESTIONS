Be sure to run any experiments with the optimizations turned on and the -g -G off.
(Edit the makefile to fix that if necessary; type: make clean; type: make)
In addition to implementing the device code, answer the following questions:

1) Suppose the size of the image is 1200 (width) by 1800 (height) and the 
program is executed with tile width = 2 and tile height = 2.  
Provide the following:

a. untiled version
size of grid (x by y):
total number of blocks:
total number of threads:

b. tiled version
size of grid (x by y):
total number of blocks:
total number of threads:


2) Which kernel version will generate the greatest number of threads and
therefore potentially have the greatest amount of parallelism?

3) In what cases would the tiled version run faster than the untiled
version?


4) The shared version reduces the number of accesses to global memory.
What other reason is the shared version faster than the tiled version?


5) You should also see in some cases that the privatization version runs 
faster than the shared version, but sometimes not.  What could make it slower?
